# Circuit-Simulator

A program that is able to read a description of a circuit from a text file, create an internal data structure for representation that allows for maximum versatility, and offers multiple services:
- `Service 1`: Find unknown/variable logic gates in the circuit
- `Service 2`: Minimize or Reduce the circuit to improve the hardware's performance

This program was developed using the `Open-Source C-Library` developed in-house.
